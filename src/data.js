		storyItself: "Today we bought a 3in1 pull-up bar because of the quarantine. We tricked the dorm engineer to screw in the hooks that will hold the bar. First we told him that we just wanted a bookshelf, but when he said that he needs the bookshelf to adjust the height, our stupid asses brought out the pull-up bar. His first reaction was to leave and tell the head of the dorm that we wanted something dangerous on the wall(let me explain why it’s dangerous, first of all, we hang onto it, and it becomes heavy, and the dorm was built in 1953, I’m not going to say anything else). Luckily we were fast enough to stop him and tell him that the pull-up bar can be hung up and taken down at any given time(Which makes no fucking sense cause we will still be pulling up and doing stupid shit on it), this one excuse for an argument was enough to convince the engineer(pizdec blya that was easy). He immediately started to drill the holes to insert the hooks. When he was on drilling the hole for the third hook we understood that we went through the wall and out so now we had a see through hole to our neighbors room(not like it was the first one). So after some scrutiny the engineer finished his job and left us with four hooks for our pull up bar, and we were left with two eye-holes to our neighbors room.",

		storyItself: "I heard there is a sale on sirki(russian sweets) in Dicksi(Walmart of Russia) today. I dress up. I leave. I stand there in front of the shelf deciding on which type of sirok I want, so that my budget wouldn’t fade away, I need money. I pick three of the cheapest ones. I notice a Dicksi woman crouching next to me while stacking up the shelves. Only problem is, what is she stacking up if she isn’t holding anything. She starts peeing. I’m standing in the puddle. I need rice. I’m at the cash register. I put all of my groceries on the conveyer belt. Cashier, a middle aged woman. I look into her eyes, I see pain, 12 years of school, an electrical engineers degree from a promising university, getting pregnant by accident, an abusive drinking husband, a marriage on the brink of collapse and overdue loans. I ask how much. She quietly answers churka. The evening in this city is so beautiful you almost want to cry.",

		storyItself: "I woke up to an alarm, hung over from yesterday and barely squeezing in three hours of sleep, I went to the laundry room, left my dirty clothes and proceeded dressing up and making my shake so that I could have breakfast on the go. I left the apartment just before the sun was about to burn the exposed part of my neck, came to the “aviakassa”. The place was already packed with people, expected, when you came in four minutes after the place opened(idiot). A fat man punches a woman in a hijab, for her political views on the right way to drop the shower curtain on the kitchen table. Now I proceed to ask everyone who is the last person in line, just so that I could hear that I’m a loved child and that my birth wasn’t a mistake. I find my place in the line and in life. Suddenly I feel a hand moving down my spine, proceeding down to my buttocks, only to see a small child and his fathers hand tickling the  levis logo on my jeans. I feel a sudden urge for blood, or maybe it’s the slain souls from the sword of Arthur that my dad passed down to me as a family heir loom. Finally I’m the first in line for the tickets and my uncles inheritance. As I slowly pull out the cash to buy the tickets I notice a glance from across the room. To my surprise it’s my will to live an another day. I pay the cashier and in return she throws the plane ticket on the ground while gently spitting on it, I politely ask her -“ti ebanulas’ dura?”, to which she embraces me like my mother used to when I was three years old. The lesson learned here today - there isn’t a right way to drop the shower curtain onto the kitchen table.",
