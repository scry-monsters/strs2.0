One day the dorm principle came to our room to do a checkup, I was alone at the moment while my roommate went outside to get oppressed. As the dorm principle was leaving I asked her if she knows anything about the neighbors who live next door to us. -Ti ebanulsya? She politely whispered into my ear. That room was empty for four years, dyadya. With that, she left like the autumn leaves, carried by the strong winds on a cold November’s afternoon.",

		storyItself: "Today we bought a 3in1 pull-up bar because of the quarantine. We tricked the dorm engineer to screw in the hooks that will hold the bar. First we told him that we just wanted a bookshelf, but when he said that he needs the bookshelf to adjust the height, our stupid asses brought out the pull-up bar. His first reaction was to leave and tell the head of the dorm that we wanted something dangerous on the wall(let me explain why it’s dangerous, first of all, we hang onto it, and it becomes heavy, and the dorm was built in 1953, I’m not going to say anything else). Luckily we were fast enough to stop him and tell him that the pull-up bar can be hung up and taken down at any given time(Which makes no fucking sense cause we will still be pulling up and doing stupid shit on it), this one excuse for an argument was enough to convince the engineer(pizdec blya that was easy). He immediately started to drill the holes to insert the hooks. When he was on drilling the hole for the third hook we understood that we went through the wall and out so now we had a see through hole to our neighbors room(not like it was the first one). So after some scrutiny the engineer finished his job and left us with four hooks for our pull up bar, and we were left with two eye-holes to our neighbors room.",

		storyItself: "I heard there is a sale on sirki(russian sweets) in Dicksi(Walmart of Russia) today. I dress up. I leave. I stand there in front of the shelf deciding on which type of sirok I want, so that my budget wouldn’t fade away, I need money. I pick three of the cheapest ones. I notice a Dicksi woman crouching next to me while stacking up the shelves. Only problem is, what is she stacking up if she isn’t holding anything. She starts peeing. I’m standing in the puddle. I need rice. I’m at the cash register. I put all of my groceries on the conveyer belt. Cashier, a middle aged woman. I look into her eyes, I see pain, 12 years of school, an electrical engineers degree from a promising university, getting pregnant by accident, an abusive drinking husband, a marriage on the brink of collapse and overdue loans. I ask how much. She quietly answers churka. The evening in this city is so beautiful you almost want to cry.",

		storyItself: "I woke up to an alarm, hung over from yesterday and barely squeezing in three hours of sleep, I went to the laundry room, left my dirty clothes and proceeded dressing up and making my shake so that I could have breakfast on the go. I left the apartment just before the sun was about to burn the exposed part of my neck, came to the “aviakassa”. The place was already packed with people, expected, when you came in four minutes after the place opened(idiot). A fat man punches a woman in a hijab, for her political views on the right way to drop the shower curtain on the kitchen table. Now I proceed to ask everyone who is the last person in line, just so that I could hear that I’m a loved child and that my birth wasn’t a mistake. I find my place in the line and in life. Suddenly I feel a hand moving down my spine, proceeding down to my buttocks, only to see a small child and his fathers hand tickling the  levis logo on my jeans. I feel a sudden urge for blood, or maybe it’s the slain souls from the sword of Arthur that my dad passed down to me as a family heir loom. Finally I’m the first in line for the tickets and my uncles inheritance. As I slowly pull out the cash to buy the tickets I notice a glance from across the room. To my surprise it’s my will to live an another day. I pay the cashier and in return she throws the plane ticket on the ground while gently spitting on it, I politely ask her -“ti ebanulas’ dura?”, to which she embraces me like my mother used to when I was three years old. The lesson learned here today - there isn’t a right way to drop the shower curtain onto the kitchen table.",

		storyItself: "Another day in this dorm. Just barely opening my eyes so I wouldn’t suddenly show that I woke up to my roommate who will perceive it as an invitation to talk and I won’t be able to squeeze in another 30 minutes of sleep. Now after an hour and a half I decided to get out of the bed, right foot first, I make no mistakes. Brush my teeth, the toilet stinks again, god knows what the neighbors next door ate(again). Wash my face, acne is not a good sign. Pull out my bowl big enough for soup but slightly way too big for tea, shit, forgot to wash it after chicken wings I ate yesterday, well, I mean it was yesterday, and the sauces are dried out on the walls of the cup, might as well save time and fill up my bowl with oats, plane oats. Pour down some boiling water, close the lid, should I be using the plastic lid to cover something so hot? yes. Now I watch my favorite episode of anything that I already watched, trust me, it is not a disorder. Now that I am done with pushing down the oats down my throat with just enough timing not to puke before I swallow - my day begins. Pull ups, yes, I have one in my poor mans homeless shelter. Abs, stretching. Finally some yoga. Why do I do all of this? am I subconsciously doing this because I know I am fat and secretly lying to myself by sucking in my stomach every time I walk around without a shirt or something skin tight? Or is it because I know that I don’t have what it takes to study in a technical university and I pour so much time into working out because it is the only thing in my life which doesn’t take much brain power and even my adhd mixed in with my bipolar disorder doesn’t stop me from finishing? Done, man that was a nice workout. Now I need to go to the shower, well, I get the towel and shampoo. I sit. Why do I need to prepare myself mentally every time I need to go to the shower? Is it because I am scared that the pores on my face are covered with sweat and oil from the workout and even the shampoo won’t wash it off, and that feeling of having a dirty face will make me think that I will get acne and clog my pores even more? I’m in the shower, wash really fast. I feel the water raise up to my ankle, suka ebanaya, the neighbor girl didn’t thrown away her hair so the drain got clogged. I get out. Wipe myself fast, important. Why do I wipe myself so fast? Is it because I’m scared that if I take too long then the skin on my head will start to peel off and I will have a lot of dandruff? Man I feel refreshed. Finally cooking dinner. I hope my roommate didn’t cook something that would stick to the bottom of the pan. Huesos, I hate him. Washed the pan for 30 minutes. I’m so happy I can finally cook. I love fried chicken with rice. Or do I love it because it’s not only easy to cook but subconsciously I just lie to myself that eating this meal everyday in longterm will make you lose weight and I won’t be worried that the only thing I’m good at which is working out doesn’t help me and this will be an another plate on the already weak shoulders that’s keeping me away from an another breakdown? Mmm delicious, as always the rice tastes great. What will I watch, Oh, half of the portion is gone. Finally I found it. An episode of a tv show I already saw seven times, no it’s not a disorder. Maybe tea? or cold water? deciding for 20 minutes. Drank the leftover black tea from two days ago, no it’s not gross or sad, I love saving up, lie. Time for bed, Finally I can read a book like I do everyday, I tell myself everyday. Jump onto instagram, vk, instagram, vk, reddit, feel pathetic and sad, instagram, dream about a future where I have a beautiful loving wife for 20 minutes, and I’m gone.",
